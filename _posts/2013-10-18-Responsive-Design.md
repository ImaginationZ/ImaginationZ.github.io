It's an honor for me to be here presenting this topic to you:
the newly developed and powerful web design tool & idea,
the responsive design.

The most content I'll cover today is based on the [slides](site.url/keynote/Responsive-design), which I picked up from the Internet. The download url is also for [ppt](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1BXy2E) and [keynote](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1d14O1).

Since the slides doesn't contain much technic details, I'll introduce some useful tools & websites for your reference.

And also a general introduce following for you.

## What is it?

The name was first introduced by
[ETHAN MARCOTTE](http://alistapart.com/author/emarcotte)
in his famous blog [Responsive Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design). 
However the idea comes from even earlier the year of 2000,
when the blog [A Dao of Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/dao) was addressed.

> The control which designers know in the print medium, 
and often desire in the web medium, 
is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. 
We should embrace the fact that the web doesnâ€™t have the same constraints, 
and design for this flexibility. 
But first, we 
must accept the ebb and flow of things

## What's the problem nowadays?
