1. Double brackets start and end multi-line strings.
2. No `++` or `--` type operators.
3. `~=` is not equals.
4. Variables are global by default; call `local var` to make a variable local.
5. String concatenation uses `..`.
6. Only `nil` and `false` are falsy. `0` and 'empty' `{}, ''` are not false.
7. Function is a return type.
8. List is devided by `,` like `a, b, c`.
9. Assignment between lists mismatched in length is available; the sender fits into the reciever.
10. Indices start at `1` !!!!!
11. A list can be seen as table with numeric index as the key.
