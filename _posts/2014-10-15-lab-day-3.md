Today I talked with Bai about my plans for the further run. 
She suggests me that A (learning) method may be obtained through multi frames of the flow, predict point moving, and hence add a term in the energy function of matching.
It's a convinience thing that can be done directly from the ground true set, and coding could be started soon.

Also a person in this area is introduced: [JiangXiong Yang](http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~qiyang/), someone be doing stereo matching and flow for years.
Plenty papers together with codes are provided too.
