It's been a while of searching before I found this one:
[A Quantitative Analysis of Current Practices in Optical Flow Estimation and the Principles Behind Them](http://cs.brown.edu/~dqsun/pubs/Sun2013QAP.pdf), a survey paper on today's stereo algorithms.

The author provided a collection of those algorithms implemented in Matlab. It's quite exciting me since there's no dependece problem any more.

More interesting thing is the author, [Deqing Sun](http://cs.brown.edu/~dqsun/index.html) postdoctor of Havard, appears to be a Hongkonger, and has been in this area for years of research.
Hope soon I can get in contact with him.
